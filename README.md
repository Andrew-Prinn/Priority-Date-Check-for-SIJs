# Priority-Date-Check-for-SIJs
This is a simple form to help immigrants apply for green cards. 
The user selects their home country and the date they filed for their visa, and the information is compared to the current requirements 
found on the State Department website at https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html. 
The purpose of this form is to help a specific group of immigrants, called Special Juvenile Immigrants, to easily determine if they are 
able to apply for a green card, or if they have to wait.
