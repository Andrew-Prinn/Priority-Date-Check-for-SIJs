This is a simple form to help immigrants apply for green cards. 
The user selects their home country and the date they filed for their visa, and the information is compared to the current requirements 
found on the State Department website (https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html) and the website alerts the user with 1 of 2 messages: either they are elligible to apply for a greencard and should consult an attorney, or they are not elligble at this time and should check back next month (new requirements are posted each month). 

The purpose of this form is to help a specific group of immigrants, called Special Immigrant Juveniles, to easily determine if they are 
able to apply for a green card, or if they have to wait to apply.
